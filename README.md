# A* Pathfinding Algorithm in Python
This repository features an implementation of the A* (A-Star) pathfinding algorithm in Python. The A* algorithm is widely used for finding the shortest path in grid-based environments, taking into account both the cost to reach a node and an estimated cost to the goal.
# Features
- A Algorithm*: Combines the benefits of Dijkstra's algorithm and heuristic-based search to efficiently find the shortest path in weighted grids.
- Heuristic Function: Utilizes the Manhattan distance as a heuristic to estimate the cost to the goal, ensuring optimal and efficient pathfinding.
- Grid Visualization: Visualizes the grid, obstacles, start and goal points, and the path found by the A* algorithm.

#Installation

```python
pip install matplotlib numpy
```
